BookmarkTags
============

About
-----

BookmarksTags is a Chrome extension that enables tagging of bookmarks.

When the extension is started, all bookmarks in Chrome that are not already
tagged are imported and tagged with the names of all directories that contain it
(e.g. a bookmark in an "Extensions" directory under a "Chrome" directory will be
tagged with "Chrome" and "Extensions"). The main view presents a list of tags
which filter bookmarks.
